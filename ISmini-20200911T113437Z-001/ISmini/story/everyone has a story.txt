life tear-jerker
A young man in his twenties was seeing out from the train’s window shouted…

“Father, look at the trees! They are going behind!”

The young man’s father smiled at the man and a young couple sitting nearby, looked at the young man’s childish comment with pity.

Suddenly, the young man exclaimed again.

“Father, look at the clouds! They are all running with us!”

The couple couldn’t resist and said to the old man.

“Why don’t you take your son to a good doctor?”

The old man smiled and said

“We did and we are just coming from the hospital. My son was blind from birth and he just got his vision today.”

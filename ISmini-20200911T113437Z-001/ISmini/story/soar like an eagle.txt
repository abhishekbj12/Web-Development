Did you know that an eagle can foresee when a storm is approaching long before it breaks?

Instead of hiding, the eagle will fly to some high point and wait for the winds to come.

When the storm hits, it sets its wings so that the wind can pick it up and lift it above the storm. While the storm rages below, the eagle soars above it.

The eagle does not escape or hide from the storm instead it  uses the storm to lift it higher. It rises on the stormy winds which others dread.

When the storm of life or challenges hit us, we can rise above them and soar like the eagle which ride the winds of the storm. Donâ€™t be afraid of the storms or the challenges in your life. Use it to lift you higher in your life.
